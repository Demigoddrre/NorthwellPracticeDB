# **NorthwellPracticeDB: Centralized SQL Server Practice Projects**

---

## **Overview**

The **NorthwellPracticeDB** project is designed to simulate real-world scenarios for Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Analyst roles. This centralized SQL Server database contains datasets and queries for various projects that focus on data analysis, visualization, and optimization. 

The project integrates **SQL Server**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, **SSIS**, **Python with Pandas**, and **Power Query** to create a cohesive environment for practicing advanced data workflows.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Install Required Software**:
   - [SQL Server Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
   - [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)
   - [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/)
   - Microsoft Excel with Power Query.
   - Python (Install Pandas and SQLAlchemy libraries).

2. **Setup the Database**:
   - Execute `scripts/create_tables.sql` to create the database schema.
   - Run `scripts/insert_sample_data.sql` to populate tables with sample data.

---

## **Usage**

### **Step 1: Run SQL Queries**
- Use `queries/projectX_queries.sql` for specific insights.
- Save outputs as views or tables for reporting tools.

### **Step 2: ETL Workflows**
- Use **SSIS** for automated data ingestion.
- Use **Python scripts** for advanced transformations.
- Use **Power Query** for quick shaping directly in Power BI or Excel.

### **Step 3: Build Dashboards and Reports**
- Connect Power BI to SQL Server to create interactive dashboards.
- Export data to Excel for detailed analysis and summaries.

## **Best Practices**
1. Centralized Database:
   - Use `NorthwellPracticeDB` for all datasets.
2. Optimize Queries:
   - Use indexes and execution plans to enhance performance.
3. Document Workflows:
   - Maintain a clear record of queries, dashboards, and ETL pipelines.
4. Regular Updates:
   - Schedule periodic updates using SSIS or Python scripts.
